# Welcome to GoInternship

I am Muhammad Jabir, I decided to come up with GoInternship because I wanted to pick up Golang for an internship that I would be embarking on and wanted to create something I would personally use. Thus, I created this Internship Applications tracker website that allows users to list their companies, update their applications, view community resources and view a nice dashboard regarding their applications.

## Deployment
https://go-internship.vercel.app/ (In the middle of migrating backend)

## Issues

If you have any issues or suggestions regarding existing or new features, do not hesitate to bring them up in the Issues segment

## Motivation

While applying for internships, I realised that there were many different ways to consolidate your ongoing applications and there were so many resources to prepare for the various stages in applying for an internship. Thus, I wanted a web app that could do all of this things
